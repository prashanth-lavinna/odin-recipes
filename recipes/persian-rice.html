        <ul>
          <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
          <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>1 russet potato, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
          <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>

          <li>1 Â½ tablespoons hot water</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover the bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.</li>
            <li>Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, then place the lid over the towels. Steam until rice is fluffy, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 1/2 tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.</li>
            <li>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
